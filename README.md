#  Software Developer Technical Assignment

Welcome! This repository contains solutions for the two-part technical assignment for the Software Developer role. Each assignment is implemented in Python with clean code, proper abstraction, and unit tests.

##  Assignment 1 – Best Threshold Selector

###  Problem
Given binary classification results (`TP`, `FP`, `TN`, `FN`) for different confidence score thresholds, find the best threshold where **recall ≥ 0.9**.

###  Example Input
```python
threshold_metrics = {
    0.1: {"tp": 96, "fp": 32, "tn": 58, "fn": 4},
    0.2: {"tp": 90, "fp": 24, "tn": 66, "fn": 10},
    ...
}
```

###  Run the Script
```bash
cd assignment1
python threshold_selector.py
```

###  Run Unit Tests
```bash
python -m unittest test_threshold_selector.py
```

##  Assignment 2 – FSM for Binary Mod-3

###  Problem
Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) to compute the remainder of a binary string interpreted as an unsigned integer **modulo 3**, **without using `%` or int conversion**.

###  FSM Details
- States: `S0`, `S1`, `S2` represent remainders `0`, `1`, `2`
- Transitions follow the FSM delta rules as described in the assignment prompt

###  Run the Script
```bash
cd assignment2
python fsm_mod3.py
```

###  Run Unit Tests
```bash
python -m unittest test_fsm_mod3.py
```

##  Code Highlights

-  Clean modular code
-  Object-Oriented Design (FSM as a generic class)
-  Full test coverage with edge case handling
-  Clear comments and naming conventions
-  No external dependencies – Python 3 standard library only

---

##  Environment

- Language: Python 3.x
- No additional libraries required
